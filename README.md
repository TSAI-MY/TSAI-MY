### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yan.

 - :seedling: Iâ€™m currently working on developing deep learning related applications in basketball.
 
 - :book: I'm currently a master of electrical engineering, mainly researching object tracking, motion recognition, and skeleton tasks, and expanding what I have learned to real-          world applications 

Please feel free. :tea:

By the way, my favorite weather is rainy.
If github world can set the weather, then I hope it is raining here . :umbrella:
